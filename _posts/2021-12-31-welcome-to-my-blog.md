In the 20+ years in the information technology field I've learned change in this industry is a constant and one must be open to it and invest the time to learn to stay relevant. Github and Jekyll are free to use tools and using it falls in line with my *learn-by-doing* philosophy.

I plan to document my learning journey here along with other interests such as leading and managing technical projects, photography, every day carry (EDC), and coffee.  If it helps or inspires you, great!  Project repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/creatorSonny).
